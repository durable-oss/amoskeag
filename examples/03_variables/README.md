# Variable Bindings

Using `let` expressions to create immutable local variables.

## Demonstrates
- `let ... in` syntax
- Variable scoping
- String concatenation with `+`
- Immutability (variables cannot be reassigned)

## Expected Output
```
"Hello, Alice!"
```

## Key Concepts
- Variables are immutable once bound
- Each `let` binding is scoped to its `in` expression
- Variables can reference other variables in their scope
