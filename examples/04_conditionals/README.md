# Conditional Expressions

Using `if/else/end` for conditional logic.

## Demonstrates
- `if` expressions (not statements)
- Mandatory `else` branches
- Chaining with `else if`
- Boolean values
- Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.)

## Expected Output
```
"Student"
```

## Key Concepts
- Every `if` must have an `else` (ensures expression always returns a value)
- Conditionals are expressions, not statements
- No "then" keyword (Ruby-style syntax)
- Can chain multiple conditions with `else if`
